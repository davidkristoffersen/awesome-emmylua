--- ### Description
--- Connect to a signal.
--- ### Parameters
--- @param name AwesomeAPISignal The name of the signal.
--- @param action function The callback to call when the signal is emitted.

--- This allows the callback function to be garbage collected and automatically disconnects the signal when that happens.
--- ### Parameters
--- @param name AwesomeAPISignal The name of the signal.
--- @param action function The callback to call when the signal is emitted.
--- ### Warnings
--- > Only use this function if you really, really, really know what you are doing.
