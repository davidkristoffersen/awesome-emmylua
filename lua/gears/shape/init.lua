--- ### Description
--- Module dedicated to gather common shape painters.
---
--- It adds the concept of "shape" to Awesome.
--- A shape can be applied to a background, a margin, a mask or a drawable shape bounding.
---
--- The functions exposed by this module always take a cairo context as first parameter followed by a width and height.
--- Individual functions may take additional parameters for their specific implementions.
---
--- The functions provided by this module only create a path in the content.
--- To actually draw the content, use `cairo:fill()`, `cairo:mask()`, `cairo:clip()` or `cairo:stroke()`.
---
--- In many case, it is necessary to apply the shape using a transformation such as a rotation.
--- The preferred way to do this is to wrap the function in another function calling `cairo:rotate()` (or any other transformation matrix).
---
--- To specialize a shape where the API doesn't allows extra arguments to be passed, it is possible to wrap the shape function like:
--- ```
--- local new_shape = function(cairo, width, height)
---   gears.shape.rounded_rect(cairo, width, height, 2)
--- end
--- ```
--- Many elements can be shaped. This include:
--- - [Client](https://awesomewm.org/apidoc/core_components/client.html#)s (See [`gears.surface.apply_shape_bounding`](https://awesomewm.org/apidoc/libraries/gears.surface.html#apply_shape_bounding))

--- - The graph (See [`wibox.widget.graph.step_shape`](https://awesomewm.org/apidoc/widgets/wibox.widget.graph.html#step_shape))
--- - The checkboxes (See [`wibox.widget.checkbox.check_shape`](https://awesomewm.org/apidoc/widgets/wibox.widget.checkbox.html#check_shape))
--- - Images (See [`wibox.widget.imagebox.clip_shape`](https://awesomewm.org/apidoc/widgets/wibox.widget.imagebox.html#clip_shape))

--- @param bottom_right boolean If the bottom right corner is rounded.
--- @param bottom_left boolean If the bottom left corner is rounded.
--- @param rate number The "squareness" of the squircle, should be greater than 1.
--- @param delta number The "smoothness" of the shape, delta must be greater than 0.01 and will be reset to 0.01 if not.
